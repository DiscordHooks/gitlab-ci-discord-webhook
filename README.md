If you are looking for a way to get build (success/fail) status reports from
[GitLab CI](https://gitlab.com) in [Discord](https://discordapp.com), stop
looking. You've came to the right place.

## Requirements
-  You should be using GitLab CI.
-  A Discord Server where notifications will be posted.
-  5 minutes
-  A cup of coffee ‚òï

## Guide
1.  Create a webhook in your Discord Server ([Guide](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)).

1.  Copy the **Webhook URL**.

1.  Go to your repository CI/CD settings (for which you want status notifications)
    in GitLab and add an environment variable called `WEBHOOK_URL` and paste
    the **Webhook URL** you got in the previous step. You can also specify
    multiple webhook addresses at once, separating each with a whitespace
    character, such as space.

    ![Add environment variable in GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/img/new_custom_variables_example.png)
    See: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#via-the-ui

1.  Add these lines, in their appropriate locations, to the `.gitlab-ci.yml`
    file of your repository.

    ```yaml
    stages:
      - notification
    success_notification:
      stage: notification
      script:
        - wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiscordHooks/gitlab-ci-discord-webhook/master/send.sh
        - chmod +x send.sh
        - ./send.sh success $WEBHOOK_URL
      when: on_success
    failure_notification:
      stage: notification
      script:
        - wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiscordHooks/gitlab-ci-discord-webhook/master/send.sh
        - chmod +x send.sh
        - ./send.sh failure $WEBHOOK_URL
      when: on_failure
    ```

1.  Grab your coffee ‚òï and enjoy! And, if you liked this, please ‚≠ê**Star**
    this repository to show your love.

### Artifacts

  If you'd like to also link the artifacts in the CI Message, set the variable `LINK_ARTIFACT` to `true`:

  ```yaml
  variables:
    LINK_ARTIFACT: true
  ```

  Make sure that the artifacts are available to download in the ```success_notification``` job. If they are produced by a previous one, you can follow [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38140996/how-can-i-pass-artifacts-to-another-stage "this StackOverflow question")

  Please also note that artifacts are only available, if ```success_notification``` has been triggered. 

### Note
- If within your gitlab CI Code, you have a pause within the script code, this notiction yml code will still run, to fix this, we need to add allow_failure: false, this will mean the job will not run unless told to(see screenshot)

-  If you face any issues in the scripts (and you're sure it's not on your side),
please consider opening an issue and I'll fix it ASAP.
-  If you want to improve the scripts, feel free to open a pull request.
-  If you are using an alpine image, you need to add `git` and `curl` packages before running this script.
   ```yaml
   # ...
     script:
       - apk add --update git curl
   # ...
   ```
